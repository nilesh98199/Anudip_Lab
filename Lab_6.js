// Question :  Write a Node.js program that displays two separate messages in the console: 
// ● "Hello, this is my first Node.js program!" 
// ● "I am excited to learn more about Node.js!" 
// Then, modify the program to concatenate these two messages into a single line and display: 

let a = "Hello, this is my first Node.js program!";
let b = "I am excited to learn more about Node.js!";
let c = a + b;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

console.log(c);

// OUTPUT
// Hello, this is my first Node.js program!
// I am excited to learn more about Node.js!
// Hello, this is my first Node.js program!I am excited to learn more about Node.js!
